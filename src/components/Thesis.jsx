        <p className="mt-6 text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Reality does not exist in flat surfaces — it curves, breathes, and remembers. This portfolio is a living structure — the manifestation of SAYAM — an entity where every design, symbol, and line connects worlds: cosmic, emotional, psychological, and divine.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Each project is a dimension. Each color — a vibration. Each form — a memory of something once felt but never spoken.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          SAYAM’s creations are not designed for reality; they are designed to define it. Through hyperreal 3D symbolism, fractal lighting, and psychological geometry, this portfolio becomes a mirror — not to reflect the world, but to rewrite its texture.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          Expect weightless architecture, breathing fabrics, celestial typography, and designs that blur morality and beauty — creations that move, listen, and evolve, like consciousness itself.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          This is not a portfolio. It’s a dimensional archive of the knowns — everything SAYAM has seen, felt, fought, and transcended.
